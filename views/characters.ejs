                    <p>Tom is a grey and white domestic shorthair cat who is always trying to catch Jerry. Despite his determination, Tom is rarely successful in catching his tiny nemesis. While he is portrayed as a normal cat who is just doing his job most of the time, he can also be sneaky and vindictive.</p>

                    <p>Jerry is a small brown house mouse who always outsmarts Tom. He is clever, innocent-looking, and usually doesn't start the fights with Tom, but once the conflict begins, he's always ready with numerous tricks. Despite their rivalry, Jerry sometimes helps Tom when he's in real trouble.</p>

He has a strong dislike for Tom, especially when Tom's antics interfere with him or his son Tyke. Despite his tough exterior, Spike is shown to be a loving father and occasionally friendly to others when not provoked.</p>
